          My name is Adrian. I am a videographer and creative professional
          hailing from the Garden State. I specialize in promotional and
          interview video productions and am currently building a web design
          portfolio (I designed this website!). My journey into video first
          began in 2007 as a side passion project while studying music at the
          University of the Arts. I still play a mean trumpet in my spare time
          and teach children's piano!

          Video is essential to modern marketing practices. This makes
          understanding how to properly implement video assets a high priority.
          With each project, my objective is to produce quality content that
          brings value to my clients, handling all phases of production and
          post-production. Let me help you bring your vision to life!
